<p>
  William Blake was an English poet, painter, and printmaker. Largely unrecognised during his lifetime, Blake is now considered a seminal figure in the history of the poetry and visual arts of the Romantic Age.

  His visual artistry led one contemporary art critic to proclaim him "far and away the greatest artist Britain has ever produced".
